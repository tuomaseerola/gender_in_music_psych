    "title": "Gender Distribution of Authors in Music Psychology",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In recent years, meta-scientific attention has increasingly turned toward music psychology, with a focus on how WEIRD (Jakubowski et al., 2025) and transparent (Eerola, 2024) the discipline is. In this study, we examine in particular an indicator of equity within the field: gender equality in authorship. Authorship visibility is critical for academic career progression, influencing recognition, funding, and advancement opportunities. Disparities in gender distribution may signal structural barriers and disciplinary cultures that constrain the diversity of contributors and hinder optimal knowledge production (Ni et al., 2021). Establishing a clear understanding of gender representation in music psychology is therefore essential for supporting a more inclusive and sustainable academic community. Previous studies across various disciplines—including psychology—have consistently revealed persistent gender inequalities in authorship, though the extent of these disparities varies by field (González-Alvarez & Sos-Peña, 2020; Rock et al., 2021; Shah et al., 2021; Son & Bell, 2022).\nAcademia suffers various equity issues, impacting productivity, innovation, and job satisfaction in the workplace, which-in turn-hugely impact academic progress. Although there are several aspects, the focus of this paper is gender inequity. Women are more at a disadvantage than men, with evidence suggesting that women are less present in positions of power. For instance, in the UK in 2016-17, 24.6% of professors are women (Bhopal & Henderson, 2021) when compared to the 44% of all grades in the UK academia (Harris et al., 2025). A similar situation holds for Italy (24% female professors) (Filandri & Pasqua, 2021), and to some extent for the United States (14%) (Spoon et al., 2023). A pay gap between men and women in academia is also significant, (e.g., female-male wage ratio is 0.85 in 2020 in the United Kingdom) (Quadlin et al., 2023). In a “publish or perish” culture of science and academia (Kiai, 2019), one crucial aspect to focus on is authorship. The number and quality (e.g., journal reputation) of authorships an individual determines crucial career development such as grant funding and future (permanent) positions.\nResearch across several scientific disciplines show that women tend to be less represented as authors compared to men (Banks et al., 2025; Son & Bell, 2022). As the topics, approaches, and methods attract differential interest from men and women, it is important to recognise that fields of scholarship and academic disciplines vary considerably in terms of gender distribution (Huang et al., 2020). For example, a large survey of authors by González-Alvarez & Sos-Peña (2020) showed that the hard sciences (N = 119,592) had the lowest prevalence of women (14.8%), whereas in the biological and social sciences (N = 262,122) the proportion was substantially higher (43.3%), but not equal. In psychology, which is perhaps the closest benchmark for the present focus on music psychology, female authors accounted for 45.2% of the sample (N = 90,067). Encouragingly, however, studies looking at various year ranges between 1960 until 2024 show a general trend that the ratio of women to men in authorships is improving (González-Alvarez & Sos-Peña, 2020; Ioannidis et al., 2023; Jemielniak & Wilamowski, 2025; Sánchez-Jiménez et al., 2024). Yet, there is evidence that this improvement is plateauing (Jemielniak & Wilamowski, 2025). Further, although women are more likely to be first author, women are still generally unfairly underrepresented as the last author (Brück, 2023; González-Alvarez & Sos-Peña, 2020; Rock et al., 2021; Shah et al., 2021).\nPast studies have explored the gender distribution according to geographical regions and in relationship to country demographics. In one study, men out-numbered women more so in high-income compared to low-income countries (Ioannidis et al., 2023). However, there are also some unexpected trends: while female representation is lowest in countries like Latin America, Caribbean (in physics journals, Son & Bell, 2022) and in South Korea, Japan, and Austria (in medical journals, Brück, 2023), females were most highly represented in countries like India and Africa (Brück, 2023; Son & Bell, 2022). Human development indicators and gender inequality indicators have also revealed systematic inequalities in academia. However, while national indicators of gender equity is positively correlated with women’s academic success (Chan & Torgler, 2020), this does not seem to be as clearly reflected in authorships. Female scientific output is not only lower in countries ranked in lowest quartile for human development and gender equity, but also in countries very high in gender equality; better equality seemed to occur in high and medium-developed countries (Sugimoto et al., 2015). Another recent paper shows that female authorship rates are most balanced in countries with low to intermediate Human Development Index (Sánchez-Jiménez et al., 2024). Overall, while socioeconomic status of certain countries might be a reason for unbalanced female authorship (Ioannidis et al., 2023), human development might not fully explain such differences (Brück, 2023; Sánchez-Jiménez et al., 2024; Son & Bell, 2022), and further research is required to better understand the trends.\nAnother aspect that differs between distribution of gender in authorship is the research methodologies and topics. In terms of methodologies, women are are less likely to publish quantitative and experimental studies, but rather publish qualitative work (Ashmos Plowman & Smith, 2011; Nunkoo et al., 2020; Sebo et al., 2020; Thelwall et al., 2019; C. Zhang et al., 2023), perhaps as they demonstrate better relational skill involved in qualitative studies, like prolonged relationships and emotional ties with research participants (Sebo et al., 2020). Interestingly, such stereotypes occur in the opposite direction: when assessing fictive research abstracts-one with quantitative and one with a qualitative design- scientific quality of the qualitative abstract was ranked more trustworthy and accurate when assigned to a female author (Johansson et al., 2002). There are also key different when assessing article keywords. In one analysis of article keywords of medical journals, female-authored articles were more associated with keywords more related to healthcare-related themes like patient involvement, insurance, and quality-of-care compared to males (Brück, 2023). Similarly, in computational linguistics, woman are more likely to publish on speech, social, and conversational topics than males; the latter are more likely to publish in formal mathematical, syntax, and semantic approaches (Vogel & Jurafsky, 2012). These trends could be explained by the idea that female researchers often conduct research on societal progress, while males prefer research aimed at scientific progress (L. Zhang et al., 2021). Overall, research shows that women choose qualitative research on social and societal topics, while males author papers using more quantitative methods on theoretical and analytical topics.\nLooking more broadly past the information within papers themselves, other research provides some further explanations for discrepancies in female/male authorships. Despite efforts to give fair credit for author contributions (Ni et al., 2021) using, for example, the Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT) system, assigning authorship can be unclear. Women are more likely to experience authorship disagreements, for example, when to decide authorship: women prefer to discuss in earlier stages, while men choose authorship at the final stage (Ni et al., 2021). Another reason for the gender gap could also come from parenthood and parental leave, which account for about ~40% of gender gap in career advancement (Nielsen et al., 2024). Additionally, women faculty perform more university, campus, and departmental services than men in general (Guarino & Borden, 2017). Fortunately, there are strides to improve the current situation, with opinion papers discussing way to improve receipt and reporting of intellectual credit (Banks et al., 2025) as well as creating equitable environments in academic science (Martı́nez-Menéndez et al., 2024). To improve academic equity issues, it is worthwhile focusing on subdiscipline to provide more ‘localised’ support to improve the equity in field. This was the aim of the current paper to look within our own field of music psychology. Indeed, the past efforts such as Anglada-Tort & Sanfilippo (2019) have already provided a current overview the publications in the music psychology field with suggestions of future directions to improve the field. Eerola (2024) showcases how Open Science practices (e.g., preregistrations, sharing research materials, data, and analysis scripts) are relatively limited, and encourage authors in the field to start implementing such practices. Jakubowski et al. (2025) explores participant samples and musical stimuli used across a wide range of experiment to give an idea of how limited or generalizable the field is. In a similar way to these papers, the current paper aims to give a current overview of gender patterns in authorship in the field of music psychology.\n\n\nOur aim is to find out what is the gender distribution in the specialist journals of music psychology. More specifically, we want to identify what is the proportion of different types of authorships (single, first, coauthors, and last authorships) for men and women in the published papers in the last 25 years? Are there specific patterns in the authorship distributions across countries, topics of the studies, or temporal trends?"

    "text": "Materials and analyses\nWe retrieved bibliographic information for all articles published between 2000 and June 2025 from five specialist journals, resulting in 3,373 unique articles: Musicae Scientiae (N = 639), Psychology of Music (N = 1,231), Music Perception (N = 675), Journal of New Music Research (N = 563), and Music & Science (N = 265). These journals have also been used in previous meta-science studies to characterise research practices in music psychology (Jakubowski et al., 2025). Author affiliations were extracted automatically and converted into country-level data. However, these were not manually verified for each entry, as affiliations are not always clearly matched to individual authors due to variations in reporting conventions, such as multiple or partial affiliations.\nIn total, the dataset included 9066 authors, of whom 5312 were unique. Author affiliations spanned 63 countries. We also extracted citation counts and Open Access status from Scopus. Information on joint first authorship was not available in the data.\nGender attribution was initially based on first names. We recognise that treating gender as a binary category is inherently problematic. Gender is a complex and multidimensional social construct. However, consistent with prior meta-science research on gender and authorship (González-Alvarez & Sos-Peña, 2020; Ni et al., 2021; Rock et al., 2021; Shah et al., 2021; Son & Bell, 2022; Wais, 2006) and that non-binary authorship generally is less than 0.1% (Son & Bell, 2022), we adopt a binary classification—male and female—for analytical purposes and assume that first names allow for a reasonable, though imperfect, attribution of gender. We used the genderize API (Wais, 2006), which predicts gender from first names and can be supplemented with country information derived from author affiliations to improve accuracy. This method resolved the gender of 89.3% of authors with a probability greater than 0.90. Only 89 names had a low attribution probability (&lt; 0.55). Unattributed cases were then checked manually, resulting in 185 manual corrections. After this process, 32 names remained ambiguous and 27 were unknown—some likely due to data entry errors in Scopus (e.g. only initials or surnames). These 59 cases were excluded from the dataset. It is likely that the due to challenge of attributing gender accurately not all the gender attributions are correct. Although genderize.io has been shown to achieve 96.6% accuracy in a diverse multinational test database without using a country of origin information – 98% with the information included – it also underperforms (82% accuracy) in Asian names (VanHelene et al., 2024). However, the error rates of these processes have been previously been shown to be non-biased, i.e. showing similar number of mistakes for both genders (Sebo, 2021; Thelwall et al., 2019; VanHelene et al., 2024).\nWe carried out manual corrections of the gender attributions where we were familiar with the author or the database had the full first name coded with initials, or the second name used as the first name. This led to 53 corrections.\nWe defined four types of authorship positions: single authorship, first authorship (which does not include papers with a single author), coauthorship, and last authorship. Coauthorship includes all positions other than first and last. These positions carry different academic prestige: first authorship is typically associated with the primary contributor, while last authorship is often held by senior researchers with established reputations (Tscharntke et al., 2007).\nFor the analyses, we analysed gender disparities in authorship by comparing the frequency of these authorship types between male and female authors. Our analysis focused on the female author proportion (FAP) and utilised odds ratios (ORs) to compare the likelihood of occupying each authorship position by gender."

    "text": "Authorship positions\nA summary of the authorship types and positions are given in Table 1. While the single-authored papers are in minority (8.6%) in this sample overall, there does not seem to be a significant difference between men and women authoring such articles (p = .21); 38.05% of single-authored papers are women with an odds ratio of 0.90 [95% 0.78-1.05] suggesting no clear gender difference despite the figures leaning towards higher frequency of male authors. The overall OR for women as first authors was 1.41 [95% CI: 1.28–1.54], indicating that the odds of first authorship are 41% higher for females compared to the male authors (Fisher’s exact test p &lt; .001). For coauthorship positions, the OR was 1.00 [0.91–1.09], suggesting no substantial gender difference (p = .96). In contrast, the odds ratio for women as last authors was 0.73 [0.67–0.81], indicating that the odds of last authorship are 27% lower for women compared to men and significantly different (p &lt; .001).\n\nSummary of authorship types across gender.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor Type\nFemale\nMale\nFemale %\nOR\nOR (CI lower)\nOR (CI higher)\n\n\n\n\nSingle\n296\n482\n38.05\n0.90\n0.78\n1.05\n\n\nFirst\n1198\n1397\n46.17\n1.41\n1.28\n1.54\n\n\nCo-author\n1245\n1853\n40.19\n1.00\n0.91\n1.09\n\n\nLast\n908\n1687\n34.99\n0.73\n0.67\n0.81\n\n\nAll\n3647\n5419\n40.23\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\nTo illustrate the trends across time in the authorship positions across the gender, we looked at 5-year-windows of the authorship types across gender, shown in Figure 1. The overall numbers across the whole data are illustrated in the first column of the graph and the remaining five columns portray the chronology in 5-year windows. The higher odds for female authors at first author position seems to be established in 2010 onwards. Female first author position exhibits a positive 5-year growth rate of +11.1%. The coauthor positions for female authors are relative stable at the odds around 1, indicating relatively equal odds between female and male authors. However, the last author positions have become relatively more rare after 2010, showing statistically significantly lower odds ratios from 2010 onwards and negative 5-year growth rate (-9.5%). The odds ratio for female single authored papers hovers around 1.0, showing no meaningful trend across the time.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorship types across time.\n\n\n\n\nThe variation of the number of authors across the papers is considerable. Here we have the maximum of 34 authors in a paper and a median of 2 (M=2.69, SD=1.77). Previous research has calculated the collaboration index across gender (González-Alvarez & Sos-Peña, 2020), suggesting that male author tend to have larger number of coauthors (M = 1.5) than female (M = 1.34) in psychology. Here the average author numbers for male and female authors (disregarding authorship positions) indicate similar difference, higher mean author numbers for males (M = 1.96, [1.91-2.01]) than for females (M = 1.71, [1.66-1.76]), t(4640.58) = 7.21, p &lt; .001, Cohen’s d = -0.21, 95% CI [-0.26, -0.15]. This analysis, however, does not allow us to distinguish the authorship roles in the counts.\nTo illustrate how the actual number of authors in a paper impacts female first author likelihood, we calculated the odds ratios across the number of authors in paper, pooling the papers with 7 or more authors together (N=749, 8.3%). We added the single-authored papers to the plot to indicate the odds of being female to be single authors compared to all studies with multiple authors. The results are shown in Figure 2. We can observe that while female authors are not more likely to be single authors than men, they tend to be more likely to be first authors than males in papers with 2 or 3 authors; the odds ratios for first authorship position for female authors for papers with 2 authors is 1.55 [130-1.85], and for 3 authors the odds ratio is 1.61 [1.35-1.92], both significantly different from equal proportion. The last authorship positions for female authors are consequently lower, odds ratio of 0.65 [0.54–0.77] for 2 authors and 0.59 [0.49–0.71] for 3 authors, both also significant at p &lt; .001 level. At four and five authors, the higher odds ratio for female is still evident (OR of 1.37 both both), but the last authorship positions are no longer relative rare for papers with 4 and 5 authors (OR 0.90 and 0.95, respectively). At six authors and above, the odds ratios indicate the same trend (higher ratio for first author, lower for last) although due to lower number of observations, these are no longer significantly different.\n\n\n\n\n\nA) Number of authors and B) female odds ratio for authorship types across the number of authors.\n\n\n\n\nFor comparison, the closest disciplinary benchmark comes from psychology, where González-Alvarez & Sos-Peña (2020) analyzed the gender distribution of 74,413 authors publishing in psychology journals in 2009. Women accounted for 45.2% of the sample, indicating near gender parity overall. However, substantial variation was observed across sub-disciplines: developmental psychology (57.0%) and educational psychology (53.8%) showed higher proportions of female authors, whereas biological psychology (39.4%), experimental psychology (37.5%), and mathematical psychology (25.8%) showed lower representation. Across the full dataset, women were slightly overrepresented in first authorship positions (OR = 1.10) but underrepresented in last authorship positions (OR = 0.86). This pattern resembles the trends identified in the present study."

    "text": "Geographical differences\nPast studies have identified consistent geographical patterns in female authorship. For example, a large-scale analysis of psychology publications found that 46.5% of authorships were by women, with European countries showing a lower average proportion of 42.8% (González-Alvarez & Sos-Peña, 2020). To examine geographical differences more closely, we calculated the odds of female authorship by the countries that have published at least 60 publications in the sample, as shown in Figure 3.\n\n\n\nFemale author odds ratio across the prolific countries publishing music psychology (with more than sixty publications).\n\n\nPanel A in Figure 3 shows a small number of countries, such as Australia, China, and Canada, with a high odds ratio for female authorship. At the other end of the spectrum, Japan, Belgium, Austria, Sweden, and Turkey all have significantly lower odds ratios for female authors. There is no simple rationale immediately apparent (e.g., country size, membership in a particular political bloc, gender equality index, or domination of articles by a single eminent scholar from one country) that would explain these differences, but this representation provides some starting points for discussion and may highlight the impact of academic career structures and principles implemented in these countries. Panel B shows data aggregated by continent, though we note that the representation is markedly different between continents. Africa has meagre representation of only 52 authors, Oceania consists only of Australia and New Zealand, and the Americas are represented almost entirely by the US and Canada. While this level of presentation may be too coarse for detailed analysis, it does offer a broad summary of the current situation. Overall, Oceanie and Americas have higher female author representation, while Asia and Europe have more a male representation."

    "text": "Citations and Open Access\nOne potential difference established in previous bibliometric analyses of gendered authorship is citations (Chatterjee & Werner, 2021; West et al., 2013). Here we tested whether the citations – as indexed by Scopus – show differences across gender. The median citation for studies with female lead authors is 10 [9–11], and for males, the numbers are identical (Md=10 [9–11]) and the difference is not statistically significant (\\(\\chi^2\\)(1)=2.14, p = 0.144) using rank-based Wilcoxon test. The same comparison of citations for studies with last authors yields similar results 9.5 [8–11], and for males, the numbers are similar (Md=11 [10–12]). Again, the difference is not statistically significant (\\(\\chi^2\\)(1)=2.04, p = 0.153). If we assume that we can weight in the gender contribution of all authors in a publication to its citation count, we observe a minor difference, where median citations for female authors is 9 [9–10], and for males, the central measure are statistically significantly higher (Md=10 [9–10], \\(\\chi^2\\)(1)=16.05, p &lt; 0.0001). For reference, prior study of citation patterns across gender in psychology has reported a small effect favoring men (M = 16.57) over women (M = 15.90) (González-Alvarez & Sos-Peña, 2020).\nWe also explored whether the open access status of the articles is associated with gender. Out of 3373 articles, 32.2% are Open Access in this sample, as indexed by Scopus. For first-authored articles, female odds ratio for Open Access is 1.49 [1.29–1.73], suggesting nearly 50% higher odds associated with publishing open access by women as compared to men. If we observe only the last authorship status of the publications, the difference vanishes with the odds ratio indisguishable from even division (1.00 and the confidence interval), OR = 0.86 [0.72–1.02]."

Disparities in gender distribution may signal structural barriers and disciplinary cultures that constrain the diversity of contributors and hinder optimal knowledge production (Ni et al., 2021). Authorship visibility is also critical for academic career progression, influencing recognition, funding, and advancement opportunities. Establishing a clear understanding of gender representation in music psychology is therefore essential for supporting a more inclusive and sustainable academic community. Previous studies across various disciplines—including psychology—have consistently revealed persistent gender inequalities in authorship, though the extent of these disparities varies by field (González-Alvarez & Sos-Peña, 2020; Rock et al., 2021; Shah et al., 2021; Son & Bell, 2022).\nEquality – Why Should We Care?\n\nLack of equity impacts:\nproductivity\ninnovation\njob satisfaction\n\nAcademia has acknowledged serious challenges in gender equity\n\nwomen less present in positions of power (e.g. 30% UK profs)\npay gap is wider in academia (16%) than in other sectors (9%)\nwomen represent fewer than 30% authorships globally\n\nWeave these studies into the narrative:\n\nNi et al.

    "text": "Materials and analyses\nWe retrieved bibliographic information for all articles published between 2000 and June 2025 from five specialist journals, resulting in 3,373 unique articles: Musicae Scientiae (N = 639), Psychology of Music (N = 1,231), Music Perception (N = 675), Journal of New Music Research (N = 563), and Music & Science (N = 265). These journals have also been used in previous meta-science studies to characterise research practices in music psychology (Jakubowski et al., 2025). Author affiliations were extracted automatically and converted into country-level data. However, these were not manually verified for each entry, as affiliations are not always clearly matched to individual authors due to variations in reporting conventions, such as multiple or partial affiliations.\nIn total, the dataset included 9,066 authors, of whom 5,573 were unique. Author affiliations spanned 63 countries. We also extracted citation counts and Open Access status from Scopus. Information on joint first authorship was not available in the data.\nGender attribution was initially based on first names. We recognise that treating gender as a binary category is inherently problematic. Gender is a complex and multidimensional social construct. However, consistent with prior meta-science research on gender and authorship (González-Alvarez & Sos-Peña, 2020; Ni et al., 2021; Rock et al., 2021; Shah et al., 2021; Son & Bell, 2022; Wais, 2006), we adopt a binary classification—male and female—for analytical purposes and assume that first names allow for a reasonable, though imperfect, attribution of gender. We used the genderizeR API (Wais, 2006), which predicts gender from first names and can be supplemented with country information derived from author affiliations to improve accuracy. This method resolved the gender of 89.3% of authors with a probability greater than 0.90. Only 89 names had a low attribution probability (&lt; 0.55). Unattributed cases were then checked manually, resulting in 185 manual corrections. After this process, 32 names remained ambiguous and 27 were unknown—some likely due to data entry errors in Scopus (e.g. only initials or surnames). These 59 cases were excluded from the dataset. It is likely that the due to challenge of attributing gender correctly not all the gender attributions are correct. However, this error has been previously been shown to be non-biased, i.e. showing similar quantify of mistakes in both directions [ref].\nWe defined three types of authorship positions: first authorship, coauthorship, and last authorship. Coauthorship includes all positions other than first and last. These positions carry different academic prestige: first authorship is typically associated with the primary contributor, while last authorship is often held by senior researchers with established reputations (Tscharntke et al., 2007).\nFor the analyses, we analysed gender disparities in authorship by comparing the frequency of these authorship types between male and female authors. Our analysis focused on the female author proportion (FAP) and odds ratios comparing the likelihood of occupying each authorship position by gender.\n\nManual corrections (to be done!)."

    "text": "Authorship positions\nThe overall odds ratio for women as first authors was 1.32 [95% CI: 1.21–1.44], indicating that the odds of first authorship are 32% higher for females compared to the male authors. For coauthorship positions, the OR was 0.99 [0.90–1.08], suggesting no substantial gender difference. In contrast, the odds ratio for women as last authors was 0.73 [0.67–0.81], indicating that the odds of last authorship are 27% lower in females. For the first and last authorship position, the odds ratios are significant at p &lt; .001 level.\nTo illustrate the trends across time in the authorship positions across the gender, we looked at 5-year-windows of the authorship types across gender, shown in Figure 1. The higher odds for female authors at first author position seems to be established in 2010 onwards. Female first author position exhibits a positive 5-year growth rate of +11.1%. The coauthor positions for female authors are relative stable at the odds around 1, indicating relatively equal odds between female and male authors. However, the last author positions have become relatively more rare after 2010, showing statistically significantly lower odds ratios from 2010 onwards and negative 5-year growth rate (-9.5%).\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorship types across time.\n\n\n\n\nThe range of the number of authors in varies considerable. Here we have the maximum of 34 authors in a paper and a median of 2 (M=2.69,SD=1.77). To illustrate how the actual number of authors in a paper impacts female first author likelihood, we calculated the odds ratios across the number of authors in paper, pooling the papers with 7 or more authors together (N=749, 8.3%). We added the single-authored papers to the plot to indicate the odds of being female to be single authors compared to all studies with multiple authors. The results are shown in Figure 2. We can observe that while female authors are not more likely to be single authors than men, they tend to be more likely to be first authors than males in papers with 2 or 3 authors; the odds ratios for first authorship position for female authors for papers with 2 authors is 1.55 [130-1.85], and for 3 authors the odds ratio is 1.61 [1.35-1.92], both significantly different from equal proportion. The last authorship positions for female authors are consequently lower, odds ratio of 0.65 [0.54–0.77] for 2 authors and 0.59 [0.49–0.71] for 3 authors, both also significant at p&lt;.001 level. At four and five authors, the higher odds ratio for female is still evident (OR of 1.37 both both), but the last authorship positions are no longer relative rare for papers with 4 and 5 authors (OR 0.90 and 0.95, respectively). At six authors and above, the odds ratios indicate the same trend (higher ratio for first author, lower for last) although due to lower number of observations, these are no longer significantly different.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorship types across author counts."

    "text": "Citations and Open Access\nOne potential difference established in previous bibliometric analyses of gendered authorship is citations (Chatterjee & Werner, 2021; West et al., 2013). Here we tested whether the citations – as indexed by Scopus – show differences across gender. The median citation for studies with female lead authors is 10 [9–11], and for males, the numbers are identical (Md=10 [9–11]) and the difference is not statistically significant (\\(\\chi^2\\)(1)=1.68, p=0.195) using rank-based Wilcoxon test. The same comparison of citations for studies with last authors yields similar results 10 [8–11], and for males, the numbers are similar (Md=11 [10–12]). Again, the difference is not statistically significant (\\(\\chi^2\\)(1)=2.13, p=0.145). If we assume that we can weight in the gender contribution of all authors in a publication to its citation count, we observe a minor difference, where median citations for female authors is 9 [9–10], and for males, the central measure are statistically significantly higher (Md=10 [9–10], \\(\\chi^2\\)(1)=14.14, p=0.0002).\nWe also explored whether the open access status of the articles is associated with gender. Out of 3373 articles, 32.2% are Open Access in this sample, as indexed by Scopus. For first-authored articles, female odds ratio for Open Access is 1.51 [1.31–1.75], suggesting over 50% higher odds associated with publishing open access by women as compared to men. If we observe only the last authorship status of the publications, the difference vanishes with the odds ratio indisguishable from even division (1.00 and the confidence interval), OR = 0.85 [0.72–1.01]."

    "text": "Gendered topics through analysis of keywords\nTo explore the potential differences within music psychology topics of choice between female and males, we analysed the keywords in the articles (41,438 in total, 5,960 unique). To reduce variant keywords, we manually simplified the variants (e.g., “arts in health”, “healthy music use”, “health musicking” were converted to “music health” and “music cognition” to “cognition” and “music perception” to “perception”) and eliminated single use of the term “music”. We aggregated the counts of keywords across all authors in the articles and Figure 4 shows the odds ratios for female authors to be associated (in any author position) with the 40 most frequently used keywords. The keywords signifying related to children, development, emotion regulation, well-being, music performance anxiety, motivation, expertise, music listening, mental health, and music therapy show significantly higher odds ratios (OR \\(\\ge\\) 1.50) for females in comparison to overall gender ratios in the data. At the opposite end of this continuum, topics such as music analysis, harmony, machine learning, computation, cognition, and performance expression show the opposite trend, suggesting that the articles with these keywords tend to have overall more prevalent male authorships (female OR \\(\\le\\) 0.75). There is much nuance and detail in the data that would warrant separate analyses; however, the purpose here is simply to provide reference points for comparing gender distributions of authorship with other disciplines, where thematic analyses have already been conducted (e.g., in sub-disciplines of psychology).\n\n\n\n\n\nFemale author odds ratio across 40 most frequent keywords in all articles as aggregated across all authors."
