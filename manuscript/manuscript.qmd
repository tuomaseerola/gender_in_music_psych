# Introduction


Equality â€“ Why Should We Care?

- Lack of equity impacts 

- productivity
- innovation
- job satisfaction

Academia has acknowledged challenges in gender equity

- women less present in positions of power (e.g. 30% UK profs)
- pay gap is wider in academia (16%) than in other sectors (9%)
- women represent fewer than 30% authorships globally


@son2022scientific Scientific authorship by gender

@shah2021gender Gender parity in scientific authorship in a National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre: a bibliometric analysis

@rock2021quantifying Quantifying the Gender Gap in Authorship in Herpetology

@ni2021gendered The gendered nature of authorship

See @gonzalez2020women for a baseline from other disciplines:

- Hard Sciences (N=119,592)  0.148
- Bio and Social Sciences (N=262,122)   0.433
- Psychology (N=90,067)     0.452

What is the situation in music psychology?

## Aims



# Methods

## Materials and analyses

- Dataset description. All papers between 2010 and 2022 from specialist journals used in [@jakubowski2024].

- Initial attribution of genders based on first names. Automatic attribution of gender based on first name databases (Gender API) + manual fixes

- Quality control.

- Manual corrections.

# Results

- Overall proportion: First authors

- First authors prevalence by Country (Figure)

- Association with the topics (Figure?)

- Time trends (Figure)

# Conclusions

Encouraging

Compare with sub-disciplines of psychology (Alvarez 2017) Psychology: First authors (N=33,631)

Female role models (past and present)

Area that appeals to women?

Not matched by musicology: 25% female profs, 38% below???
